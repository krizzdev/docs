# Roadmap

This page contains the planned upcoming features and changes in their foreseeable priority.

> Refer to [Releases](releases.md) for details about published versions.

Up until the v3.1 release, Vanilo used to have versions with features scheduled ahead.
Frankly speaking, we rarely met those deadlines. As another undesired side effect,
the promise of those releases has also made additional features to be kept back,
thus slowing the entire release pace down.

As of v3.1 (Nov 7, 2022), the roadmap and the release policy have changed as follows:

- the roadmap no longer contains version numbers and release dates
- the roadmap contains the scheduled features in priority order 
- the release frequency will be higher (new version every 2-3 weeks; similar to Laravel's cycles)
- releases will be smaller
- minor changes and improvements will be released faster
