### Frontend Assets

The Admin of the new version is built on top of [AppShell v2](https://konekt.dev/appshell/).

The Laravel mix (webpack) compilation has slightly changed.

Update `webpack.mix.js` so that it look something like this:
```js
mix.js('resources/js/app.js', 'public/js') // <- default js, comes with Laravel. /!\ `resources/assets/js` with Laravel < 5.7
    // These 2 lines are for Vanilo Admin (AppShell):   
   .js('vendor/konekt/appshell/src/resources/assets/js/appshell.standalone.js', 'public/js/appshell.js')
   .sass('vendor/konekt/appshell/src/resources/assets/sass/appshell.sass', 'public/css')
    // default css, comes with Laravel:  /!\ `resources/assets/js` with Laravel < 5.7
   .sass('resources/sass/app.scss', 'public/css');
```

It's recommended to use Laravel Mix v2:

In `package.json`:

```json
{
   "laravel-mix": "^2.0"
}
```

Run these commands to install new dependencies and compile the assets:

```bash
yarn install
yarn run dev
```

## 0.2 -> 0.3

### Minimum Versions

If using the [Vanilo Framework](modules-vs-framework.md), then the minimum versions are:

- Laravel 5.5
- PHP 7.1.3
- GD Extension is required for product images

Minimal requirements for components (without Framework):

- Laravel 5.4
- PHP 7.0

### New Buyable Methods

The `Buyable` contract has 3 new methods, thus if any of your models implements `Buyable`, you also
have to implement them:

1. `hasImage()`
2. `getThumbnailUrl()`
3. `getImageUrl()`

The [support](https://github.com/vanilophp/support) package offers default implementations for the
new, image related methods:

- `BuyableNoImage`: "Null image" trait for products that don't actually have images.
- `BuyableImageSpatieV7`: Adapter for using images with [Spatie's Laravel Media Library V7](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-medialibrary).


### BaseRequest Moved From AppShell To Concord

If you used the `Konekt\AppShell\Contracts\Requests\BaseRequest` in your application, then you need
to use `Konekt\Concord\Contracts\BaseRequest` instead.

As of AppShell v0.9.7 the interface has been moved to Concord v1.1.

### Migrations

There are some, run them:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### Storage Link Required

For product image support, your application should have a
[storage link](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/filesystem#configuration).

To create the symbolic link, you may use the storage:link Artisan command:

```bash
php artisan storage:link
```

### Rebuild The Assets When Using The Admin

If you're using Vanilo's Admin, then rebuild your assets (eg. `yarn run dev`) to catch up with the updated look&feel.
